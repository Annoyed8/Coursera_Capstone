    "The final project of IBM capstone project is to predict the severity of car accident in term of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of impact of accident.  The data was provided by Coursera and collected by Seattle SPOT traffic management division. The data is from 2004. The data contains information such as severity code, address type, location, collision type, weather, road condition, speeding, among others."
